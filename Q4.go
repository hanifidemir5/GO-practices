// Write a user management project which will include;
// • A master view which will list all users in a data grid. This screen will assist
// users with all CRUD operations. User will be able to press 3 buttons
// (New,Edit,Delete). Edit and Delete operations will require row selection from the data grid.
// • A detailed view which will show the fields as form. Form will have 2 buttons (Action,
// Back). Text of the action button will change according to the
// operation opened the detail view. For example if the “New” operation is selected from
// the master, the detailed view action button text will be “Create”. Please see the
// mappings below.
// ▪ New: Create
// ▪ Edit: Save
// ▪ Delete: Delete

// and HTTP Statuses are important for us. Please follow REST API standards.

// the project folder. Remember all operations must be persistent.
// • Frontend must be written with TS using React & Nextjs.
